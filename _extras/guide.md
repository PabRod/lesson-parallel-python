## Computing Pi
- The first challenge of implenting the monte-carlo algorithm for computing pi is meant also to
  gauge the participants. How quick are they? Do they have much experience? If they have a hard time
  drop some hints, and ajust your pacing for the rest of the lesson.

## Dask abstractions
- Word counting challenge: depending on the level of the participants, you can help them along by
  giving a skeleton, or showing how to count the total number of words before hand.
  Use your own favourite book from Gutenberg, this adds a personal touch to the lesson.
